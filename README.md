run `yarn start` and `yarn story` to start, then run the app with either `xed ios` and press play, or `npx react-native run-ios`

`showStorybook` to show storybook or regular app

`centered` decorator works when I put it in `AwesomeButton.stories.tsx` as a decorator, but it doesn't work when it's in `storybook/index.ts` as a global decorator.
